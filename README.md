About
-----

LiveSPICE is a circuit simulator that attempts to run in real time with minimal latency for audio signals.
It processes signals from audio input devices attached to your computer, and plays the results to the speakers.

For more information, see http://www.livespice.org.

--------

The LiveSPICE solution requires the ComputerAlgebra project: https://github.com/dsharlet/ComputerAlgebra

To clone the LiveSPICE repo, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dsharlet/LiveSPICE.git LiveSPICE
